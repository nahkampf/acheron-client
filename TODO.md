- [X] Update sensor list
- [X] Update signal list
  - [ ] On each update go through the list and remove orphaned signals
  - [ ] "Designation" editor for signals
- [ ] Update SURFOPS position list
- [ ] Bonus idea: Sensors can become "decalibrated". If possible make some interesting interface where sensor operators can "recalibrate" them. (look at https://jsfiddle.net/kwn83xtv/)
